# Hello again! 


---

# On Monday we talked about

- How to know when a Shiny app is the right tool for the job

--

- How to build a basic Shiny app and get data in and out


---

# Today (Wednesday) we will cover

- Deploying your Shiny app

--

- Building cool/interactive maps using `{leaflet}`

--

- Using Shiny to make a tutorial in `{learnr}`

--

- ...and then we'll just gaze at some great apps


---
# Deploying your Shiny app

## Deploy to the cloud
- Sign up for a free shinyapps.io account

- Install `{rsconnect}` 

- Configure `rsconnect` to use your account using a token from your shinyapps.io account:

![shinyappsio](img/shinyappsio.png)

---
# Deploying your Shiny app

## Deploy to the cloud
- If you add a new token and click 'show', you'll get instructions for how to configure `rsconnect` 

- Then you use `rsconnect::setAccountInfo() to configure your rsconnect installation. This will link your shinyapps.io account to your local environment:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name="<ACCOUNT>", token="<TOKEN>", secret="<SECRET>")
```

- Then, you can deploy from within RStudio by clicking the 'Publish' button in the RStudio IDE, or use the console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rsconnect::deployApp(server = "shinyapps.io")
```

That's it!

# Deploying your Shiny app

## Other options for deployment

### Deploy to an RStudio Connect account (local, commercial option)

### Publish on Shiny Server (local, open source)

---
# Getting credit for your Shiny development

If you've put a lot of time into making a Shiny app, you should get credit! 
The publication/credit avenues are unconventional for Shiny apps, but they DO exist.

- Publish as a package in an open source software journal (e.g., [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/) ) (check out the `{golem}` pkg for structuring your files and streamlining production) `r emo::ji("package")`

- Publish code straight from GitHub with a DOI from Zenodo ( [here](https://www.rinproduction.com/en/posts/005-8-tips-for-a-production-ready-shiny-application/) are some good tips for preparing your app for production )

- (for "just for fun" apps): submit your Shiny app to the RStudio [Shiny contest](https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-contest-2020-is-here/51002)
<!-- see if you can get some data on citation rates for JOSS vs zenodo github entry -->
